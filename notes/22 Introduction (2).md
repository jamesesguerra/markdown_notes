# 08/13/22 Introduction

> __digital__ - data/signals expressed as a series of the digits 0 and 1
> __digitize__ - converting (pictures, text, sound) into a digital form that can be processed by computers

### Human vs Data communication

Human communication is more ambiguous because it is richer and therefore, also less predictable. 
- words vary from context to context
- different factors influence how people perceive messages

Data communication is more precise
- information is replicated exactly 
- computers don't need to interpret, they just relay messages

### Types of information

- voice, data, image, video

Information sources can produce information in __digital__ or __analog__ form.
- __digital__
  - discrete values
  - digital clock, finite values
- __analog__
  - continuous
  - infinite values
  - information rate & channel capacity measured in Hz
    - __hertz__ - unit of measure for the # of times a wave cycle occurs in a second
  - bandwidth measures the limits

### How data is transmitted

- __face to face__ - same space, same time, multiple sense
- __written__ - different space, different time, one sense e.g. telegraphy
- __remote verbal__ - different space, same time, one sense e.g. telephone
- __remote face to face__ - different space, same time, two senses e.g. video conferencing

### How networks are described
__function of time__
- analog (varies smoothly over time)
- digital (constant level over time, followed by a change to another level)

__function of frequency__
- spectrum (range of frequencies)
- bandwidth (width of spectrum)

#### Periodic signal characteristics
- __amplitude (volts)__ - the height from the center line to the top/bottom 
- __frequency (hertz)__ - cycles/per unit time; cycle = 2 mountains
- __period__ - amt of time for 1 cycle; space between mountains
- __phase__ - relative position in time

### Signal Modulation

It defines how info is stored in the signal wave; process of converting data into radio waves by adding info to an electric signal
- amplitude modulation
- frequency modulation
- phase modulation

### How data is encoded




funciton of frequency
- transmit via note; different ferquency
- 
signal modulation
- different height and speed could mean different things
- 
AM stations have a wder reach

FM better quality

analog converted to digital converted to bits

use 1000 bits per second

how do you encode text
- 
picture resolutino x rgb

losless
50 mb picture = 5mb in storage

dolby channel 6

nqyust

multiply kbps by duration
