# 0: Introduction

C is a general-purpose programming language associated with the UNIX system where it was developed. The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system or machine; and although it has been called a _"system programming language"_ because it is useful for writing compilers and operating systems, it has been used equally well to write major programs in many different domains.

C provides a variety of data types. The fundamental data types are characters, and integers and floating point numbers of several sizes. In addition, there is a hierarchy of derived data types created with pointers, arrays, structures, and unions. Expressions are formed from operators and operands. Pointers provide for machine-independent address arithmetic.

C also provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for well-structured programs: statement grouping (blocks), decision-making (if-else), selecting one of a set of possible cases (switch), looping with termination test at the top (while, for) or at the bottom (do), and early loop exit (break).
C is a relatively _"low level"_ language. This means that C deals with the same sort of objects that most computers do, namely, characters, numbers, and addresses. These may be combined and moved about with the arithmetic and logical operators implemented by real machines.

A significant contribution of the ANSI C standard is the definition of a library to accompany C. It specifies functions for accessing the operating system, formatted input and output, memory allocation, string manipulation, and the like.
