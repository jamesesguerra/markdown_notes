# 0: Introduction

- __Algorithm__ 
  - method for solving a problem
  - a function `f(n)` that takes input and produces an output
  - made in the design phase of solving a problem; implementation phase is coding the algorithm in a programming language
  - need to analyze correctness and efficiency (in terms of time and space)
- __Data structure__
  - method for storing information that is associated with the algorithm acting on it
  - stores and organizes data so that it can be used efficiently by an algorithm
  - has implementation code for its interface (ADT)
- __Interface (ADT)__
  - outlines the operations of a particular data structure, but does not say how it should be implemented
  - example: sequence (list) interface is an ADT for the `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java
