# 3: Stacks and Queues

These are fundamental data types (ADT). They don't necessarily care about how they're implemented. It doesn't matter whether you implement them with arrays or linked lists. What matters is that their behavior (FIFO & LIFO) is implemented.

- value: collection of objects
- operations: __insert__, __remove__, __iterate__, test if empty
