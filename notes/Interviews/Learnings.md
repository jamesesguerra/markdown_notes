# Learnings

1. See what effect will sorting do. It might give you some insight as to how the problem can be solved. The problem could be solved using binary search.
2. Parsing expressions - possible to use stacks
3. use min max functions for comparing
  - instead of:
  ```py
  if currentSum > maxSum:
    maxSum = currentSum
  ```
