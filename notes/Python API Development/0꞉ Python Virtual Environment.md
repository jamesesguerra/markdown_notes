# 0: Python Virtual Environment

One project needs one version, another project needs another version. With virtual environments, you can create an isolated environment that won't affect any other environment. You can install any python package running any version.

#### Create a virtual environment
```sh
py -3 -m venv <name>
```

#### Use interpreter in venv instead of global interpreter

#### Activate virtual environment
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```
