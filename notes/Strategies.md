# Strategies

### Clarify the question

A good way of clarifying the question is to state a concrete instance of the problem. Use unit tests: you could ask "if the input array is `[2, 20, 30]` and `k` is 3, then are you supposed to return 1, the index of 20?"

Ask the interviewer what time and space complexity he/she would like in your solution.

### Work on concrete examples

Some problems may seem difficult at first. Try examining some small examples to get key insights.

### Spell out the brute-force solution

Problems tend to have an obvious brute-force solution that has a high time complexity compare to more sophisticated solutions. Instead of trying to work out a DP solution for a problem, try out all the possible configurations. It helps you explore opportunities for optimization, it gives you an opportunity to demonstrate some problem solving skills, and it establishes that both you and the interviewer are thinking of the same problem.

### Think out loud

It's always a good idea to think out loud and stay engaged. It forces you to put your thoughts in a coherent manner.

### Apply patterns

Patterns are general reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems. Examples include finding a good data structure, seeing if your problem is a good fit for a general algorithmic technique, e.g., divide-and-conquer, recursion, DP, or mapping the problem to a graph.

## Presenting the solution

Once you have an algorithm, it's important to present it in a clear manner. Your solution will be much simpler if you take advantage of libraries such as Java Collections.
