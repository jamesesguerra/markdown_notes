# C++

#### Why Bjarne Stroustrup created C++

In the early days, people had to write their code to directly to work on the hardware, with LOAD and STORE instructions to manipulate bits. You can do work with this but it's specialized. 

They then figured out how to build languages fit for humans for specific areas. FORTRAN was built for engineers and scientists, COBOL for businessmen. In the 60's, someone thought of making a language fit for humans for all domains. They built SIMULA and introduced classes. Classes are things you have in a program to represent a concept in your application world. You can represent just about anything with a class. They also went further by representing classes in a hierarchical relationship through inheritance. This is OOP or data abstraction.

His idea was to take the idea's of SIMULA for general abstraction for the benefit of representing things so that humans could get it, with low-level stuff. And the best language for low-level stuff was C. He took these two ideas and brought them together so that you could do high-level abstraction efficiently enough, and close enough to the hardware for demanding computing tasks. C++ has classes like SIMULA and runs as fast as C code.

#### What makes it a widely-used language?

- Its ability to have abstractions and be so efficient that you can afford it in infrastructure and access hardware directly as you often have to do with OS systems and infrastructure in general.
- Stability - you don't have to fiddle with it often and rewrite it.
