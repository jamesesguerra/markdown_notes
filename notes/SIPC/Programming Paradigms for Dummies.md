# Programming Paradigms for Dummies

## Introduction

Programming languages are usually complicated, but their important ideas are simple. 

Solving a programming problem requires choosing the right concepts. A _programming paradigm_ is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathematical theory or a set of principles. Each paradigm supports a set of concepts that make it the best for a certain kind of problem. For example, OOP is best for problems with a large number of related data abstractions organized in a hierarchy. 

Different programming languages need different programming concepts to solve problems cleanly. A language should ideally support many concepts in a well-factored way, so that the programmer can choose the right concepts whenever they are needed. This is called _multiparadigm_ programming. Nevertheless, understanding the right concepts can help improve programming style even in languages that do not support them.

## Languages, paradigms, and concepts

Languages realize paradigms that consists of a set of concepts. Many languages implement the same paradigm with only minor differences.
